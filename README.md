# rp-chat

This is my attempt to make a fivem script.

All that i uppload here is kinda owned by me/not this is since i borrow others since im trying to learn LUA.

How to add this to your server.

1. Drag the rp-chat folder in to your FXserver/resources and drop it.
2. Go to your server.cfg and write `start rp-chat`
3. Start you server and test it out!

Commands:

`/staffanno {message}`
`/eventanno {message}`
`/serverannounce {message}`

Remember this is HALF owned by me.
